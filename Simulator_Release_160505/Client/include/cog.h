/**
 * @file cog.h
 * @brief Inludes common API definitions for COG programming.
 *
 * @details  Each COG includes 16 32 bit special purpose registers.
 * The purposes of the registers are to provide control over user I/O
 * input and output. Some registers like INB, OUTB, DIRB are not used
 * with P8X32A.
 *
 * The state of each physical input pin is available to any COG via INA.
 * Output pin values are the bitwise "wire OR" of all the COGs at the
 * physical output pins when the DIRA bits are set high (1).
 *
 * OUTA bits control the state of the physical output pins.
 * If one COG sets a pin to output high (1), and another COG sets the same pin
 * to output low (0), the high (1) will be set.
 *
 * The per COG special purpose register summary:

 Register Description

 PAR      Parameter register is used for sharing HUB RAM address info with the COG.
 CNT      The system clock count
 INA      Use to read the pins when corresponding DIRA bits are 0.
 INB      Unused in P8X32A
 OUTA     Use to set pin states when corresponding DIRA bits are 1.
 OUTB     Unused in P8X32A
 DIRA     Use to set pins to input (0) or output (1).
 DIRB     Unused in P8X32A
 CTRA     Counter A control register.
 CTRB     Counter B control register.
 FRQA     Counter A frequency register.
 FRQB     Counter B frequency register.
 PHSA     Counter A phase accumulation register.
 PHSB     Counter B phase accumulation register.
 VCFG     Video Configuration register can be used for other special output.
 VSCL     Video Scale register for setting pixel and frame clocks.

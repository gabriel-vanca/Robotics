  // in world coordinates. (Note that the centre is NOT the midpoint

  // bottom left corner. +ve x points to the right, +y points up and
  // positive theta is in a clockwise direction. The transformation
  // which this encodes is "rotate by an angle theta and then
  // translate by x and y".

  // (e.g., drive_goto) is under way. Therefore, only apply this when
  // the robot is stationary, probably at the very start of the
